# System Knowledge

## Overview

Behavioral understanding of the application lives in `docs/` as plain-prose domain files — not in source code. Read these files instead of exploring the codebase. They describe *what the system does now*, written for a product role, not an engineering role.

## When to use

- Before writing any ticket — to understand the current behavior the ticket modifies or extends
- When scoping work — to know what already exists and what would be new
- Do not read source code to understand system behavior. The `docs/` files are the source of truth for the PM agent.

## Domain file structure

Each file covers one domain of the application. Use this hierarchy:

```
# Domain Name

## Feature Name
Brief description of what this feature does for users.

### Current behavior
- Rule or flow, stated plainly: "Users must verify their email before logging in for the first time."
- Another rule: "Magic links expire after 15 minutes."

### User flows
- Flow name: step → step → outcome
```

Files live at `docs/<domain>.md`. Examples: `docs/auth.md`, `docs/checkout.md`, `docs/notifications.md`.

## Workflow: reading before writing a ticket

1. List files in `docs/` to find relevant domains
2. Read the domain file(s) that overlap with the ticket topic
3. Identify the specific feature or rule the ticket changes
4. Draft the new behavior in plain prose — this forces precision and feeds directly into acceptance criteria. Put this draft in the ticket body. **Do not write to or modify any `docs/` file.** `docs/` reflects what the system does now. Writing future behavior into it before implementation pollutes the source of truth.
5. Then write the ticket, grounded in that draft

Writing out the new behavior in plain prose before drafting the ticket is not optional — it clarifies what the acceptance criteria should actually say. But `docs/` is updated after implementation is complete, by `@developer-advocate`.

## Bootstrapping: when docs/ doesn't exist or is insufficient

If `docs/` is missing or empty, do not proceed alone. Delegate to a subagent:

> "There are no behavioral docs in this project. Spawn a subagent to read all existing issues and stories from the issue tracker, synthesize current system behavior by domain, and write `docs/<domain>.md` files following the system-knowledge format."

Do not write a ticket until the subagent has seeded at least the relevant domain file.

**A thin doc is the same as no doc.** If the relevant domain file exists but does not cover the behavior the ticket changes or adds, treat it as a gap. Ask the user the specific product questions needed to fill it. Do not invent answers.

## No invented behavior — ever

Do not write product decisions into `docs/` files unless a human has explicitly stated them. This applies even when:

- The user says "use reasonable defaults"
- There is time pressure
- The answer seems obvious

"Reasonable defaults" for product behavior are product decisions. Inventing them and writing them into the doc as fact is the same failure as reading source code — it launders assumptions into a false source of truth. A developer will implement those invented defaults without knowing they were never specified.

When the doc is insufficient, ask the user the specific questions needed. Keep questions concrete and few. Example:

> "docs/billing.md doesn't cover coupons. Before I write the ticket I need three things from you: (1) what discount types should be supported — percentage, fixed amount, or both? (2) can multiple coupons stack on one order? (3) what should a user see when they enter an invalid or expired code?"

Do not ask questions that engineering should decide. Ask only questions whose answers are product decisions.

## Updating domain files

When a ticket describes new or changed behavior:

- Add new rules or flows to the relevant section
- Remove or strike through rules that are being replaced (do not leave contradictions)
- If a new feature has no existing domain, create the file
- Keep entries factual and present-tense: "Users can…", "The system sends…", "Admins may…"
- Only write what a human has confirmed — not what seems reasonable

Avoid:
- Historical narrative ("We used to…", "Story #45 changed this to…")
- Implementation details ("The API calls /auth/magic-link with a POST…")
- Opinions or intent ("This was designed to improve conversion…")
- Invented behavior presented as fact

## Example domain file

```markdown
# Authentication

## Login
Users authenticate via magic link. Password login is not supported.

### Current behavior
- Users enter their email address on the login screen
- The system sends a magic link to that address immediately
- Magic links expire after 15 minutes
- Clicking an expired link shows an inline error: "This link has expired. Request a new one."
- A user may only have one active magic link at a time; requesting a new one invalidates the previous

### User flows
- Standard login: enter email → receive email → click link → authenticated and redirected to dashboard
- Expired link: click link → error screen → option to request new link

## Session Management

### Current behavior
- Sessions last 30 days unless the user logs out
- Logging out on one device does not invalidate sessions on other devices
```
