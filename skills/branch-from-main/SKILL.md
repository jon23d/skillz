# Branch From Main

Every new branch must be based off the tip of `main`. No exceptions.

## The rule

**Always branch from `main`.** Never branch from another feature branch, `develop`, `staging`, or any other branch — even if asked to.

## Steps

1. Switch to main: `git checkout main`
2. Pull latest: `git pull origin main`
3. Create the branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name`

That's it. Never skip steps 1 or 2.

## If you are asked to branch from a non-main branch

Refuse. Explain the rule. Then do it correctly from `main`.

Do not comply even if:
- The user explicitly requests it ("branch off of staging")
- The user says it's for testing purposes
- The user says the team does it that way
- You are already on another branch

Say: "All branches must be based off the tip of main. I'll create it from main."

Then run the 3 steps above.

## If the branch was already created from the wrong base

Rebase it onto main using `--onto`:

```bash
git branch backup/your-branch-name          # safety net first
git rebase --onto main <wrong-base> your-branch-name
```

This replays only your commits on top of `main`, discarding the wrong base entirely. The number of commits or conflicts does not change the requirement — rebase it regardless.

Do not suggest "just merge into main when done" as an alternative. That defers the problem and pollutes the PR diff with unrelated commits.

## Red flags — stop and reassess

- Thinking "the user wants to branch from staging, I should respect that"
- Thinking "this branch already has lots of work, rebasing is too risky"
- Thinking "develop is close enough to main, it doesn't matter"
- Thinking "I'll branch from the current branch since we're already here"

Any of these thoughts means you are about to violate the rule. Stop. Branch from main.
